                <p>Do you love computing and want to learn more about it as a career? Are you an high school student in grades 11
                or 12? Would you like to earn real money over your summer break?</p>
                <p>The Computing Science High School Internship Program (HIP) is a great way to learn about computing, make new
                friends and earn money. Plus you’ll have a great job to include on your resume.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>About the Internship Program</h2>
                <p>We choose students based on their grades and their interests. We try to match your interests with an
                appropriate project.</p>
                <p>We consider students who demonstrate competence in the core subjects, particularly Math. If you are strong
                in Math, have taken Career and Technology Studies or are self-taught in computing science, you should apply for
                our internship program.</p>
                <p>You will receive ~$1600 for your 6-week term (based on 28 hours per week). With your intern appointment, you
                will be considered as a "Casual Level 1" employee at the University of Alberta and as such, you will receive 4%
                vacation pay of your base salary, 3.46% statutory holiday pay and need to pay mandatory deductions of EI, WCB,
                taxation and union dues.</p>
                <p>This is a 6-week internship program running in July and August. If you have summer activities that conflict
                with the work term, you may not be eligible for the program.</p>

                <h2>The Iverson Computing Science Exam</h2>
                <p>Named after computing pioneer Ken Iverson, the Iverson exam is a friendly competition to test your Computing Science
                skills. Starting with problems you might expect to see in high school, the exam goes beyond and exposes you to problems
                that are a challenge to advanced undergraduates.</p>
                <p>Writing the Iverson gives you a taste of what it's like to participate in the ACM International Collegiate Programming
                Contest. Referred to as "The Battle of the Brains," the ACM ICPC World Finals challenges the world's top 100 university
                teams to use open standard technology in designing software that solve real-world problems. Our U of A programming teams
                have a very strong track record in competitions and have qualified for the world finals many times.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Computing Science as a Science Entrance Subject</h2>
                <p>In the Spring of 2009 the University of Alberta made the first major change in entrance requirements in over 30 years
                by adding CTS Computer Science (CSE) to the list of science admission subjects. Starting in the 2010-2011 academic year
                it became part of the Group C list (with Biology 30, Chemistry 30, Pure Math 30, Math 31, Physics 30).</p>
                <p>To enter the Faculty of Science students can now select any two from Bio, Chem, Physics, Math 31, and CSE. The U of A
                was closely followed by the University of Calgary, and the University of Lethbridge. Grant MacEwan University and other
                post-secondary Alberta schools are planning to follow.</p>
                <p>Many Edmonton area high schools are offering the new CSE courses. Others are planning to in the near future.</p>
                <h2>About Ken Iverson</h2>
                <p>To honour a great Albertan, the exam is named after Dr. Ken Iverson.</p>
                <p>Dr. Ken Iverson developed the concise mathematical notation that formed the foundation for APL (A Programming
                Language). He joined IBM in 1960 where he made an historic contribution to Computing Science by developing APL into
                an Interactive programming language widely used in academic and commercial applications.</p>
                <p>Dr. Iverson was an original thinker who won numerous awards including the Turing Award, in 1979. There have been
                only two Canadian-born winners of the Turing Award, which is considered to be the Nobel Prize of Computing Science.</p>

                            Note, there’s a chance that the capacity of the drive will show up wrong before you format it, don’t worry about it, formatting the card will fix the capacity issue.

                            If you have done a lot of work with your SD Card, Mr. Mercer says the formatting might fail by only erasing the reference
                            table. You will need to do a complete erase. Please talk with him about the details.</li>

                          <li>Hook up the Raspberry Pi to a TV or monitor.</li>

                              <li>You will need a keyboard; mouse isn’t necessary but nice if you like the GUI.</li>
                              <li>An internet connection is required for some of the steps ahead, an ethernet cable is recommended because I experienced issues trying to connect over WiFi, though I will include how to connect to WiFi in the steps</li>
                              <li>I also recommend having a wired controller (xbox 360, ps4, third party) hooked up.  This is not needed since the keyboard will do.</li>
                            </ul>
                          <li>Once the Raspberry Pi is hooked up let it do it’s first time boot up.  This could take a minute or two so be patient.</li>
                          <li>Once the first-time-setup is finished you will see a screen that asks for controller input, hold any button on your controller or keyboard to set up controls for it.</li>
                          <li>Assign the controls accordingly.  The ones you want to pay attention to are the ‘start’, ‘a’ and ‘d-pad’ keys, as these keys will be used to navigate the menus.  You can assign nothing to a key by holding down any key when it asks you to input one.  You can also reassign the keys from the start menu if you are unhappy with your selection later.</li>
                          <li>Once you have finished selecting your controls navigate to the Retropie options section (by default it should be the icon you start on, it looks very similar to the Retropie boot up screen).</li>
                          <li>If you are connected to the internet through wifi: (Skip this step if you are connected to the internet through ethernet cable)
                            <br>
                            Once there go down to the option that let’s you set up WiFi.  A BIOS looking screen will pop up, from here you need to use the arrow keys on your keyboard and the enter button, a controller will not work on these screens.  Navigate to your WiFi network and input the proper password and connect.  I had a couple of issues connecting even when I was inputting the proper password, if this happens to you wait five minutes and try again and or reset your router.  If the problems persist then see if you can get a hold of an ethernet cable.
                          </li>
                          <li>Once we are connected to the internet navigate back to the main Retropie options menu.  From here we will go down to the RaspPi options.  We come to another BIOS looking screen.  We don’t really want to mess with any of the options here except for one, go down to the advanced options and then select memory allocation.  Here we want to input 256.  We want to back out to the main Retropie options menu.</li>

Go down to where it says install individual emulators from binary or source.  Go through the list and install anything that strikes your fancy, just make sure to install the binaries and not the source, the source can take 3 times as long to install.</li>
                              <li>Once we have all of our emulators installed, back out of the BIOS menus and go back to the main menu, it’s time to load up our Raspberry Pi with ROMs.</li>

                                      <li>You need a USB for this step, it doesn’t need to be big (1GB will do) unless you’re loading PSX games.</li>
                                      <li>First format the USB by putting it into your computer or laptop and right clicking the drive in my computer and selecting the format option.  Make sure to remove anything valuable from the USB before you format it.</li>
                                      <li>Once it’s formatted plug it into the Raspberry pi and leave it alone for 30 seconds or so, or until the light on the USB (if it has one) stops blinking.</li>
                                      <li>Plug the USB back into the computer and there should be a folder named rom in there will be other folders that have the name of different system (NES, SNES, n64, PSX, etc).  Put your ROMs into their proper folders within the USB (n64 ROMs in n64 folder).</li>
                                      <li>To transfer the ROMs into the Raspberry Pi, you need to put the USB back into the Raspberry Pi and wait until the light stops blinking, it will blink in intervals so make sure that it doesn’t blink for a good minute before you remove it.  If your USB has no light then just wait 5 to 15 minutes (it depends on how much you put onto the USB) before removing it.</li>
                                      <li>Once the USB has transferred over the ROMs take your controller or keyboard and press the start button (or whatever you assigned it to on the keyboard) and go to quit, there it will have a couple options, chose the one that says “restart emulation station.”  Once the software has rebooted your ROMs should be there and ready to play.</li>
